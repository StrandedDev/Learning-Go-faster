# Learning Go Lang Faster

In this project i will try to learn go programming language as fast as i can. I will list down every important aspects of Go programming language and then i will read some docs of that particular topic and write some codes and try to understand how things work out.

I will try to learn and document the whole journey in this [*github repo*](https://github.com/StrandedDev/Learning-Go-faster), all the garbage code i'll write will be pushed in here with folders and files.
