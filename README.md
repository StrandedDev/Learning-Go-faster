# Learning Go Lang Faster

In this project i will try to learn go programming language as fast as i can. I will list down every important aspects of Go programming language and then i will read some docs of that particular topic and write some codes and try to understand how things work out. 

I will try to learn and document the whole journey in this [*github repo*](https://github.com/StrandedDev/Learning-Go-faster), all the garbage code i'll write will be pushed in here with folders and files. Ypu can jump through clicking different urls to navigate to specific topics and also jump straight to the related folders and notes i've made. Remember this is not Go lang [docs](https://go.dev/doc/) this is just me.

## Installing Go in your machine

Head over to the [official downloads page](https://go.dev/doc/install) then download and run the installer file. This will install Go on your machine. 

Run below command in cmd or terminal to verify installation. 

```bash
go version
```

Here is the dedicated folder for [installation](https://github.com/StrandedDev/Learning-Go-faster/tree/main/Topics/Installation) and my first [hello world](https://github.com/StrandedDev/Learning-Go-faster/blob/main/Topics/Installation/hello_world.go) file.
